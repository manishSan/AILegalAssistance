**Re:** Sarah Chen v. Michael Rodriguez
**Claim No.:** ESI-2025-
**Date of Loss:** March 15, 2025

Dear Ms. Walsh:

This letter constitutes a demand for settlement in the above-referenced matter.

## Statement of Facts

On March 15, 2025, at approximately 2:30 PM, our client, Sarah Chen, was lawfully crossing Madison
Avenue at East 42nd Street in Manhattan when she was struck by a vehicle operated by your insured,
Michael Rodriguez. The intersection was controlled by traffic signals, and Ms. Chen was crossing with the
pedestrian walk signal when Mr. Rodriguez, traveling southbound on Madison Avenue, failed to yield the
right-of-way and made a left turn onto East 42nd Street, striking Ms. Chen in the crosswalk.

The accident was witnessed by multiple pedestrians and was captured on nearby surveillance cameras.
The responding NYPD officer issued Mr. Rodriguez a citation for failure to yield to a pedestrian in a
crosswalk (VTL ยง 1151). Weather conditions were clear and dry, and there were no obstructions to
visibility. Mr. Rodriguez admitted to the investigating officer that he "didn't see" Ms. Chen before making
the turn, demonstrating his failure to exercise reasonable care.

## Injuries Sustained


As a direct and proximate result of this collision, Ms. Chen sustained significant injuries including:

```
Fractured left tibia and fibula requiring surgical repair with titanium plates and screws
Severe soft tissue injuries to her left leg, hip, and lower back
Traumatic brain injury with post-concussion syndrome symptoms including headaches, dizziness,
and cognitive difficulties
Multiple contusions and abrasions throughout her body
```
Ms. Chen was transported by ambulance to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital where she underwent
emergency surgery on her leg fractures. She remained hospitalized for six days and subsequently
required extensive physical therapy and rehabilitation. Her orthopedic surgeon has advised that she will
likely require additional surgery to remove the hardware in 12-18 months, and she continues to
experience chronic pain and limited mobility. Her neurologist has indicated that her post-concussion
symptoms may persist for an additional 6-12 months.

## Damages Claimed

Ms. Chen's damages as a result of this preventable accident include:

1. **Medical Expenses (Past):** $127,450.
    Emergency room treatment and hospitalization
    Surgical procedures and hardware
    Physical therapy and rehabilitation
    Neurological treatment and testing
2. **Medical Expenses (Future):** $35,000.
    Anticipated hardware removal surgery
    Ongoing physical therapy
    Continued neurological treatment
3. **Lost Wages (Past):** $18,200.
    10 weeks of missed work as a graphic designer
    Salary: $52,000 annually
4. **Lost Wages (Future):** $12,800.
    Estimated 6 additional weeks of reduced capacity
5. **Pain and Suffering:** $350,000.
    Severe physical pain and ongoing discomfort
    Permanent scarring and disfigurement


```
Loss of enjoyment of life activities
```
6. **Emotional Distress:** $25,000.
    Anxiety and depression following the trauma
    Fear of crossing streets and walking in the city

**Total Damages:** $568,450.

## Settlement Demand

Based on the clear liability of your insured and the significant damages sustained by Ms. Chen, we
demand the sum of **$485,000.00** to settle this matter in full. This demand is reasonable considering the
severity of Ms. Chen's injuries, the permanent nature of some of her conditions, and the substantial
impact this accident has had on her life and livelihood.

## Liability Analysis

Your insured's liability is clear and indisputable. Under New York Vehicle and Traffic Law ยง 1151, drivers
must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians crossing within a crosswalk. Mr. Rodriguez's failure to observe
Ms. Chen before making his turn constitutes negligence per se. Additionally, his violation of the traffic
law, as evidenced by the citation issued, establishes his breach of duty to exercise reasonable care. The
causation between his negligent conduct and Ms. Chen's injuries is direct and undeniable.

## Time Limit for Response

receipt. If we do not receive a reasonable settlement offer by August 9, 2025, we will be forced to pursue

## Closing Statement

We believe this matter can be resolved amicably through reasonable negotiations. Ms. Chen has suffered
tremendously due to your insured's negligence, and she deserves fair compensation for her injuries and
losses. We look forward to your prompt response and hope that Empire State Insurance Company will act
reasonably and in good faith to resolve this claim.
